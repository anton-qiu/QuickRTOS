Quick RTOS is based on a small RTOS I develop back in 2007 for learning purpose. It has some of the basic RTOS function like task scheduling and simple semaphore. The task scheduling is based on round robin with different level of priority as well.

Quick RTOS currently only developed for LPC2138 and does not have many Hardware Abstraction Layer or any service like file system of TCP/IP. The code was compiled using the free version of Keil MicroVision3 V3.12a (C Compiler V2.20a).
